### `OrthoConsult`

This project is my first in-depth UX and Development project/product that has a real life context that will be used by real people.

### Development: Incorporating New & Old Concepts

A big focus for this project is in storing, viewing and managing data so aside from utilizing more React Hooks as in my other projects, I delved into Firebase. The current list of dependencies (at the moment) are the following:

- [React Hooks](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-reference.html#useeffect)
  - [useState](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-reference.html#usestate)
  - [useEffect](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-reference.html#useeffect)
  - [useContext](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-reference.html#usecontext)
  - [useReducer](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-reference.html#usereducer)
- [React Router](https://reactrouter.com/web/guides/quick-start)
- [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/)
  - [FireStore](https://firebase.google.com/products/firestore)
  - [Storage](https://firebase.google.com/products/storage)
  - [Authentication](https://firebase.google.com/products/auth)
  - [Hosting](https://firebase.google.com/products/hosting)
